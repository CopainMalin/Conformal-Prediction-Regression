# Conformal-Prediction-Regression
Implementation of conformal prediction with MAPIE based on a MAPIE doc example and adapted to another regression dataset (where the exchangeability still holds true).
Conformal Prediction is a way to quantify uncertainty without any assumptions regarding the model or the data (or errors) generating process which is quite promising.
